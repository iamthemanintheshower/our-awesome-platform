# our-awesome-platform
The aim of this project is to provide tools to the programmers that love to work "in cloud" (with just a good browser), on different projects in the same time and want to keep track of everything.

https://gist.github.com/joashp/a1ae9cb30fa533f4ad94 is used as inspiration to make private/_classes/encryption.php


Next release: (already developed, testing in local environment)
- create an automatic backup at each save event with history, search in file, list of today's saved files, upload and uncompress .zip files
- db management tool for each project
- tracking system (automatically track the time you spend on each project)
- chat with collegues and easy cut/paste from the chat to the todo list manager

TODO:
- for each project, add a log viewer (just adapt this code https://github.com/iamthemanintheshower/wp-exceptions-mng)
- InputChecker->getParametersWhitelist() => add the parameters for each position
- InputChecker->checkParameters => add the require/formal check + token (just adapt this code https://medium.com/@imthemanintheshower/another-form-validator-for-wordpress-5161efd2e673)
