With "Our Awesome Platform" we can change the way web programmers work. Join the team to make the difference.

Group projects by customers, edit PHP files with a comfortable online editor, test the website/application with the viewer, work on the database and automatically track everything without exit the platform.

Under one login, you have all tools you need to work as a web programmer.

FEATURES:
- Web FTP client with PHP editor (CRUD operations on files with a Web FTP client, encrypte details storage);
- Automatically backup every single edit of a file (it makes a copy of the file every time you save it);
- Download all the files you edited in the current session with one click or send the backup to a remote server;
- Upload and uncompress;
- Work on a "dev" environment and go live with a click;
- Transform an HTML template to a WordPress template, easily;
- DB management tool for each project (CRUD operations on tables of the database associated to the project);
- Select project in a group of projects;
- Edit pictures online;
- Easy download an entire project, database included;
- Tracking system (automatically track the time you spend on each project and each function)
- File edit history (see all changes you have made with the FTP editor);
- Search in file (search a string inside of files of the project)

Next release: (already developed, testing in local environment)
- chat with collegues and easy cut/paste from the chat to the todo list manager
